In this activity, I created an Amazon-like storefront with a MySQL data based linked to it. The app takes in orders from customers and deplete stock from the store's inventory.

How to use it?

Select from the threee different options: "View all inventory", "See anythign you like in our inventory?", "Become one of our Suppliers. Join our Team!",

"View all inventory" will eneable you to see all of the inventory. "See anythign you like in our inventory?" will eneable you to buy something you like "Become one of our Suppliers. Join our Team!" will enable the user to become a supplier.

For more information, here is the link and it's functionality: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Q7wjaqreg-Ru4SzIaCqHSAutW12wpvhb/view
